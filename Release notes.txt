AForge.NET 1.4.2 release notes
------------------------------
01.08.2007.

Version updates and fixes:

* General
  - Added new namespaces: Video.DirectShow;

* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - VideoCaptureDevice class added to access local video capture devices like USB webcams
    using DirectShow;
  - FileVideoSource added to access video files using DirectShow (DirectShow supports more
    video codecs than Video for Windows so this class allows to play wider range of video
    files).
